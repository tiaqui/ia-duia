The Abalone Dataset involves predicting the age of abalone given objective measures of individuals.

It is a multi-class classification problem, but can also be framed as a regression. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 4,177 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

Sex (M, F, I).
Length.
Diameter.
Height.
Whole weight.
Shucked weight.
Viscera weight.
Shell weight.
Rings.
The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 16%. The baseline performance of predicting the mean value is an RMSE of approximately 3.2 rings.
